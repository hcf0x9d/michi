                <p class="mt-0">I’ve seen too many small teams with big hearts get tripped up by technology. Messy websites, unclear
                    messaging, expensive tools—these things shouldn’t get in the way of the work you’re really called to
                    do.</p>
                <p>After years of working in design, development, and marketing strategy—often as the solo UX voice in a
                    room—I realized my passion wasn’t just in building better products. It was in <b>helping people do
                    meaningful work more clearly and confidently</b>.</p>
                <p>That’s why I’ve shifted my focus to <b>supporting ministries, nonprofits, and small startups</b>: the
                    teams doing the most with the least. You shouldn’t need a degree in digital strategy to show up well
                    online.</p>

                <p>I’ve spent the last decade helping small companies and mission-driven teams build better
                    experiences—from intuitive app flows and marketing funnels to full design systems and scalable
                    platforms. I’ve worked as a one-person UX department, led design ops at fast-growing startups, and
                    mentored designers to grow their craft with confidence.</p>
                <p>I am happiest when I’m blending systems and soul—designing thoughtful digital strategies that serve
                    people, not just pixels.</p>
                <p><b>I believe:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design should feel like peace, not pressure</li>
                    <li>You don’t need more tools—you need the right ones</li>
                    <li>Good work grows from small steps taken faithfully</li>
                    <li>There’s beauty in clarity</li>
                    <li>Most digital problems are people problems in disguise</li>
